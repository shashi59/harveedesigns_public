    	<h1>Our Nest</h1>
        
       <!-- <h3>Duck & Duckling</h3>
         
        <h4>Endless love and Care</h4>
                
                <p>Infant early start-up level program  is specially designed to provide the little one a comfortable, safe and a happy environment with the parent. It is exciting and rewarding to see the little one explore and gradually learn through various innovative activities.  They will move to music, play with water, paint messy pictures, read touch-and-feel books and do lots more. This program focuses on self-growth, social interaction, hand-eye coordination, and the development of fine and gross motor skills.</p>-->
        
        
       <h3>The Nestlings</h3>
               
        <h4>Freedom to explore</h4>
               
                <p>Toddlers are more mobile and are able to walk. This program provides freedom to explore, develop gross motor skills and flourish.  Children now will be able to do more things with their hands as they are now free from crawling.</p>
                <p>We focus on toddlers' growth, early communication and natural curiosity. The curriculum is designed to develop children's physical skills of agility, balance, climbing and co-ordination through the use of brightly colored specialized equipment.</p>
        
		<h3>The Fledgeling</h3>
               
        <h4>Discover New</h4>
		  
				  <p>The kids explore materials and activities, discover new things. The curriculum is designed with a blend of indoor and outdoor activites such as art & craft, music, puzzles, matching & sorting, sand pit, water splash area and dough play. As we know, children are wonderfully inquisitive at this age. We support curiosity and offer encouragement to discover new answers. Each child develops talents and abilities through play with peers and teachers, and is allowed to grow at his/her own pace.</p>
