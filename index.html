                <p>Infant early start-up level program  is specially designed to provide the little one a comfortable, safe and a happy environment with the parent. It is exciting and rewarding to see the little one explore and gradually learn through various innovative activities.  They will move to music, play with water, paint messy pictures, read touch-and-feel books and do lots more. This program focuses on self-growth, social interaction, hand-eye coordination, and the development of fine and gross motor skills.</p>
